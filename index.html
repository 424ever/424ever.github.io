        <p>
          As many others, I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams'
          <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>. So, after reading it for
          the first time, I quickly adapted 42, which in the book is
          <i
            >the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and
            everything</i
          >, as my (no doubt very original) favourite number. Hence the username
          42-4(for)-ever.

      As such, stay safe, and don't forget your towel.
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the
          most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.
          Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for
          warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
          on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
          inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the
          stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to
          sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in
          hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes
          or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a
          mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it
          can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress
          signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be
          clean enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some
          reason, if a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him,
          he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a
          toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map,
          ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
          Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of
          these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally
          have "lost." What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch
          the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
          against terrible odds, win through and still knows where his towel is,
          is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
